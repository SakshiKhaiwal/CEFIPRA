The genomic and evolutionary landscape of drug resistance in budding yeast

### Summary:

Antimicrobial drug resistance occurs when microbes such as bacteria or fungi evolve the ability to withstand drug treatment normally used to inhibit their growth. 
This has become a big threat to public health with existing treatment methods being rendered ineffective by drug-resistant microbes. Drug resistance is a complex trait, which means it is controlled by a large number of genetic and environmental factors. To understand the relationship between genetic variations and drug resistance and to further identify the causal variants, a species-level survey is required. 

In this project, we measured the growth rate and yield of 1011 clinical, domesticated, and wild-sequenced S. cerevisiae strains across six antifungals belonging to major antifungal classes. Genome-wide association studies on these traits can identify drug resistance to natural genetic variants.
